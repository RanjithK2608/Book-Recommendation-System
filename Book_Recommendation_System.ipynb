        "A recommendation engine, also known as a recommender system, is software that analyzes available data to make suggestions for something that a user might be interested in.\n",
        "\n",
        "A recommendation engine can be used for recommending other products besides books; for example a recommendation engine can be used to suggest movies or t-shirts or any other product based on things like similar customers who bought similar products. On Amazon’s ecommerce website, you can see an area populated by a recommendation engine, it’s the area that you see “Customers who viewed this item also viewed” and “Customers who bought this item also bought” lists.\n",

        "The algorithm recommends a product that is similar to those which used as watched. In simple words, In this algorithm, we try to find finding item look alike. For example, a person likes to watch Sachin Tendulkar shots, so he may like watching Ricky Ponting shots too because the two videos have similar tags and similar categories.\n",
        "Only it looks similar between the content and does not focus more on the person who is watching this. Only it recommends the product which has the highest score based on past preferences.\n",

        "Collaborative based filtering recommender systems are based on past interactions of users and target items.  In simple words here, we try to search for the look-alike customers and offer products based on what his or her lookalike has chosen. Let us understand with an example. X and Y are two similar users and X user has watched A, B, and C movie. And Y user has watched B, C, and D movie then we will recommend A movie to Y user and D movie to X user.\n",
        "Youtube has shifted its recommendation system from content-based to Collaborative based filtering technique. If you have experienced sometimes there are also videos which not at all related to your history but then also it recommends it because the other person similar to you has watched it.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Hybrid Filtering Method:**\n",
        "It is basically a combination of both the above methods. It is a too complex model which recommends product based on your history as well based on similar users like you.\n",
        "There are some organizations that use this method like Facebook which shows news which is important for you and for others also in your network and the same is used by Linkedin too."
